## Admin Fee Calculation Fix

### Issue Identified
- Discrepancy in admin fee calculation for Chip East Northporf LLC (tenant ID 1334)
- Letter showed admin fee of $60,945.37 while billing data showed only $609.45
- Root cause: The tenant's `fixed_pyc_share` value (0.7) was being misinterpreted
  - Intended to represent 0.7%, but was being treated as 70% due to calculation error

### Fix Implemented
1. Updated `calculate_tenant_share_percentage` function in `New Full.py` to handle decimal percentages correctly:
   - Added check to detect if value is already in decimal form (less than 1)
   - If less than 1, kept the value as is
   - If 1 or greater, divided by 100 as before

2. Applied similar fixes to other percentage handling functions:
   - `calculate_cap_limit`
   - Functions handling `min_increase` and `max_increase`

3. Updated Chip East's tenant settings file:
   - Changed `fixed_pyc_share` from 0.7 to 0.007 to correctly represent 0.7%

### Proper Percentage Handling Guidelines
For consistency in tenant settings files:

| Percentage Type | Recommended Format | Example |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Less than 1%    | Decimal form      | 0.007 for 0.7% |
| 1% or greater   | Regular form      | 2.21 for 2.21% |
| Alternative     | String with % sign | "0.7%" |

### Verification
- Ran CAM reconciliation for ELW property
- Confirmed that admin fee calculation now correctly applies 0.7% share for Chip East
- Admin fee now shows consistent value in both letter and billing data
