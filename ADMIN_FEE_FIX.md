# Admin Fee Calculation Fix

## Issue Description

The letter generator was overriding calculated admin fee totals with values from tenant data when there was a mismatch. This caused mathematical inconsistencies in the GL breakdown tables, where row sums didn't add up to column totals.

The two main issues were:

1. **Admin Fee Override Logic**: Lines 882-905 in `enhanced_letter_generator.py` were replacing calculated admin fee values with tenant data values.
2. **Row Total Formatting**: Admin-fee-excluded rows weren't properly calculating and formatting their totals.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Removed admin fee override logic:

Changed from:
```python
# If our calculated admin fee differs from the tenant data value, use the tenant data value
if not admin_fee_match:
    print(f"DEBUG [GL totals]: WARNING - Admin fee mismatch! Using tenant data value for consistency")
    total_tenant_admin_fee = tenant_admin_fee_value
    total_admin_fee_formatted = format_currency(total_tenant_admin_fee)
    
    # Recalculate final amount
    expected_total = total_tenant_gl_amount + total_tenant_admin_fee
    if has_cap:
        expected_total -= total_cap_impact_raw
        
    # Only update the final amount if it differs from what we calculated from the individual rows
    if abs(expected_total - total_final_amount) > 0.01:
        print(f"DEBUG [GL totals]: WARNING - Final amount mismatch! Recalculating with tenant data admin fee")
        total_final_amount = expected_total
        total_final_amount_formatted = format_currency(total_final_amount)
```

Changed to:
```python
# Verify calculation but DON'T override our calculated values
if not admin_fee_match:
    print(f"DEBUG [GL totals]: NOTE - Admin fee mismatch, but using calculated value from GL breakdown")
```

This ensures that the letter always shows the mathematically correct totals based on the individual rows in the table.

### 2. Fixed row total calculation for admin-fee-excluded rows:

Changed from:
```python
if is_admin_excluded:
    # For admin fee excluded rows, the total should be just the tenant's share
    latex_row = f"{formatted_desc} & \\${gl_amount} & \\${tenant_gl_share} & \\textit{{Excluded}} & \\${tenant_gl_share} \\\\\n"
```

Changed to:
```python
if is_admin_excluded:
    # For admin fee excluded rows, the total should be just the tenant's share
    final_amount = float(tenant_gl_share.replace(',', ''))
    latex_row = f"{formatted_desc} & \\${gl_amount} & \\${tenant_gl_share} & \\textit{{Excluded}} & \\${format_currency(final_amount)} \\\\\n"
```

This ensures consistent formatting for the row totals and maintains mathematical correctness.

## Testing Results

### CAM-only Reconciliation (ELW 2024):
- Admin fee calculation: $3,012.44
- Admin fee match: True
- Row totals and column totals match correctly

### CAM+RET Reconciliation (ELW 2024):
- Admin fee calculation: $5,395.97
- Admin fee match: False (tenant data value was $3,012.44)
- Letter correctly uses the calculated value $5,395.97
- Row totals and column totals match correctly

## Benefits of Fix

1. **Mathematical Integrity**: The totals in the GL breakdown table now properly reflect the sum of the individual rows.
2. **Debugging Retained**: The system still logs admin fee mismatches, but doesn't modify the calculated values.
3. **Consistent Formatting**: All row totals are now consistently formatted using the format_currency() function.

This fix ensures that the CAM reconciliation letters accurately represent the breakdown calculations, making it easier for tenants to understand their charges.
