This script scans the New Full.py file to find and fix any code that might be 
scaling override amounts based on date patterns like "Jan-Apr" in the description.

Since the issue appears to be an unintended adjustment where the override amount 
is being multiplied by a factor around 1.458 (ratio of 10725.50 / 7353.92), 
this script will search for patterns that could be causing this behavior.
